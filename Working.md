Current status...

got the basic VueJS stuff set up with Grunt using JavaScript and HTML
did another project using VueJS... can incorporate lessons learned there

create a version that continues to be JavaScript + HTML
create the same version that's CoffeeScript + PUG

in the future, can use other frameworks and platforms

The goal is:

1.  Have a photo manager that I'll want to use
1.  Use this project to learn and experiment with different frameworks
1.  Use this project as a potential reference for future projects (rather than learning by doing work projects, then not having access if I were to switch jobs)
1.  Potential portfolio?
